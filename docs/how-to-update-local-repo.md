To update your local Git repository with changes from the remote repository, follow these steps:

### 1. **Fetch Updates from the Remote Repository**
This will retrieve the latest changes from the remote repository without modifying your working directory.

```bash
git fetch origin
```

This command fetches all branches from the remote `origin` (the default remote name) and updates your local references.

### 2. **Merge the Changes into Your Local Branch**
After fetching, you need to merge the changes from the remote branch into your current branch. For example, to merge updates from the `main` branch:

```bash
git merge origin/main
```

This will apply the changes from the remote `main` branch to your current branch.

### 3. **Use `git pull` to Fetch and Merge Automatically**
If you want to both fetch and merge in one command, use:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

This command will pull the latest changes from the remote `main` branch and merge them into your current local branch.

### Notes:
- Ensure that your local branch is up to date with the remote branch to avoid conflicts.
  
If conflicts arise during the merge process, you'll need to resolve them manually before committing the merge.
