### 7. Synchronizing Your Local Branch with the Remote

Sometimes, when you initialize a repository locally and push it to GitHub, your local branch may not be fully synchronized with the remote branch. These commands will ensure everything is correctly aligned.

1. **Set the Upstream Branch**  
   This step ensures your local `main` branch tracks the remote `main` branch on GitHub.
   ```bash
   git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main
   ```

2. **Stash Local Changes (Recommended)**  
   If you have any uncommitted changes that are not ready to be committed yet, stash them temporarily. This saves your changes without committing them:
   ```bash
   git stash
   ```

3. **Pull and Rebase Changes from the Remote**  
   If there are any changes on GitHub that you donâ€™t have locally, you need to pull them. Using the `--rebase` flag ensures that your changes are applied cleanly on top of the remote changes:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   ```

4. **Apply the Stashed Changes (If Any)**  
   If you stashed changes in step 2, you can now reapply them to your working directory:
   ```bash
   git stash pop
   ```

5. **Increase Git Buffer Size (Optional)**  
   If you are pushing a large amount of data or large files, increasing the Git buffer size helps avoid errors:
   ```bash
   git config --global http.postBuffer 524288000
   ```

### Explanation:
- **Setting the upstream branch** ensures Git knows which remote branch your local branch should follow.
- **Stashing** temporarily stores your work to avoid conflicts while syncing your branch.
- **Rebasing** helps create a cleaner history by replaying your local commits on top of the remote changes.
- **Increasing the Git buffer size** ensures that large pushes are handled without network errors.
