Got it! Let's focus only on **Windows (Chocolatey)** and **macOS (Homebrew)** and revise the guide accordingly. I'll also include the command to refresh PowerShell after installing Chocolatey without needing to close and reopen it.

Here's the updated version:

# How to Install Popular Package Managers

This guide will walk you through the process of installing popular package managers on **Windows** and **macOS**. These package managers simplify the installation of software and dependencies, making your development workflow more efficient.

## Installing Chocolatey (Windows)

**Chocolatey** is a package manager for Windows that makes it easy to install and manage software from the command line.

1. Open **PowerShell** as Administrator:
   - Press the `Windows` key, type **PowerShell**.
   - Right-click **Windows PowerShell** and select **Run as Administrator**.

2. Check the current execution policy by running the following command:
   ```bash
   Get-ExecutionPolicy
   ```

3. If the command returns `Restricted`, you need to change it. You can either use the **Bypass** policy (which is easier for installations) or the **AllSigned** policy (which is more secure):
   - To use **Bypass**:
     ```bash
     Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
     ```
   - To use **AllSigned**:
     ```bash
     Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned
     ```

With PowerShell's execution policy configured we can ensures that we can run the necessary installation scripts for Chocolatey

3. Run the following command to install Chocolatey:
   ```bash 
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
   ```


3. After Chocolatey is installed, **refresh your PowerShell session** without closing it by running:
   ```bash
   refreshenv
   ```

### Step 2: Verify Installation
To verify that Chocolatey was installed correctly, run:
```bash
choco -v
```

You should see the version number of Chocolatey, which confirms that the installation was successful.

### Step 3: Installing Software Using Chocolatey
Once Chocolatey is installed, you can easily install software packages. For example, to install Git:
```bash
choco install <package-name>
```

This will automatically download and install the package on your machine.

## 2. Installing Homebrew (macOS)

**Homebrew** is a popular package manager for macOS that simplifies the installation of software from the command line.

### Step 1: Install Homebrew

1. Open the **Terminal** app on your Mac.
2. Paste the following command to install Homebrew:
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. It will also prompt you to install Xcode Command Line Tools if they are not already installed.

### Step 2: Verify Installation
After the installation is complete, verify that Homebrew is installed by running:
```bash
brew --version
```

You should see the version number of Homebrew, which confirms that the installation was successful.

### Step 3: Installing Software Using Homebrew
To install software using Homebrew, use the following syntax. For example, to install Git:
```bash
brew install <package-name>
```

This will automatically download and install the package on your Mac.
